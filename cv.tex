  {Expected to submit in December 2017.}

\degree{2010–2014}
  {Computer Systems and Software Engineering (M.Eng)}

\section{Experience}

\employed{May–Aug 2016}
  {Software Engineering Intern}
  {Pusher}
  {London}
  {\begin{tightitemize}
    \item Contributed to the implementation of a distributed system
      using \keyword{Go} and \keyword{Raft consensus}:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Rewrote the storage subsystem, improving benchmark
        performance by a factor of 30.
      \item Fixed bugs and implemented missing functionality, bringing
        error rate down from 80\% to 0\%.
      \item Integrated with \keyword{Stagger}, an open-source,
        in-house, metric reporting service.
      \item Reduced maximum garbage collector pause time by a factor
        of 200.
        \item Implemented \keyword{m-of-n sharding}.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Implemented a tool for \keyword{fuzz testing} arbitrary Go
      interfaces (\textbf{\githublink{pusher}{go-interface-fuzzer}}):
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Behaviour is compared against a reference implementation
        and programmer-specified invariants.
      \item Regression testing can be performed by using a prior
        version as the ``reference'' implementation.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{tightitemize}}

\employed{Oct 2014–now}
  {Research Student}
  {University of York}
  {York}
  {\begin{tightitemize}
    \item Researcher in the Programming Languages and Systems group,
      investigating the testing of \keyword{concurrent programs},
      using \keyword{Haskell}.
    \item Wrote \keyword{D\'ej\`a Fu}, a concurrency testing library
      (\textbf{\githublink{barrucadu}{dejafu}}):
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Allows the deterministic and systematic testing of
        concurrent Haskell programs.
      \item Supports almost all of standard Haskell concurrency.
      \item Has realistic execution semantics, including an
        implementation of the \keyword{x86} / \keyword{x86\_64}
        relaxed memory model.
      \item Resulted in one peer-reviewed publication.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{tightitemize}}

\employed{Jul–Sep 2014}
  {Software Engineering Intern}
  {CoreFiling}
  {Oxford}
  {\begin{tightitemize}
    \item Refactored an extensively-used in-house wiki program, fixing
      numerous long-standing bugs.
    \item Built a parser/renderer for a Creole-like markup language
      using \keyword{ANTLR} in \keyword{Java}.
    \item Wrote a \keyword{JIRA} plug-in enabling the use of this
      markup in issue descriptions and comments.
    \end{tightitemize}}

\section{Open Source}

\contribution{Aug 2016–now}
  {Sole Developer}
  {logdb}
  {\githublink{barrucadu}{logdb}}
  {Wrote a \keyword{Go} general-purpose, fast, log-structured
    database. It ensures the consistency of data written to disk in
    the event of unexpected termination, and can be used as a storage
    backend for the \keyword{hashicorp/raft} library.}

\contribution{2010–2015}
  {Project Leader}
  {Arch Hurd}
  {\httplink{www.archhurd.org}}
  {Managed a small, geographically-diverse, development team porting
    core \keyword{Linux} software to the \keyword{GNU/Hurd} platform.
    Also produced installation media and maintained a website and
    online software repository.}

\contribution{2009}
  {Developer}
  {Uzbl}
  {\httplink{www.uzbl.org}}
  {Was part of a small development team that implemented early-stage
    functionality in an open-source web browser using \keyword{C} and
    \keyword{git}.}
