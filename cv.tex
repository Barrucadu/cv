\subsection{GoCardless}
\begin{cventry}{\orange{Mar~2022}}{Software Development Engineer}
  \begin{tightitemize}
    \item Designed and led implementation of a new \keyword{event sourcing} approach to our core payment processing logic, which will allow other teams to decouple their services from the main monolith.
    \item Worked on improving scalability of a key part of our API:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Designed a \keyword{table partitioning} strategy to remove expensive queries, reducing peak API latency by 95\%.
      \item Worked with product, support, and marketing colleagues to co-ordinate a breaking change to the availability of historic data over the API with users.
      \item Refactored a large Rails monolith, to split components out into separate microservices.
      \end{itemize}
  \item Assisted with incident triage and response, including contributing to a working group to improve our practices.

\section{Education}

\subsection{University of York}

\begin{cventry}{\range{2014}{2019}}{Ph.D in Computer Science}
  My thesis ``Revealing Behaviours of Concurrent Functional Programs
  by Systematic Testing'' examined the deterministic testing of
  concurrent programs with shared memory and message passing.
  Supervised by Colin Runciman, and examined by Simon Peyton Jones and
  Ana Cavalcanti.
\end{cventry}

\begin{cventry}{\range{2010}{2014}}{M.Eng in Computer Systems and Software Engineering}
  My dissertation on the formal verification of stop-the-world garbage
  collectors received first-class honours.  Overall, I achieved a 2:1.
